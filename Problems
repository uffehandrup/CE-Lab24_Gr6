We've had several problems, but one reccuring problem we've had is that the OpenCR's firmware stops working everytime we meet in again on monday. We haven't figured out the root of the 
problem, but we found that re setupping the firmware was the solution even if a bit temporary. The weird thing was, that it wasn't when we restarted the bot, only when we met monday 
morning. 
We had a new problem with it though in week 11, when the bot refused to update the OpenCR. This seemed weird as we had no prior problems, and the guide didn't mention the problem. 
It was fixed by using the sudo command to ensure we had the rights to update every directory.

We've had problems connecting to the internet, where it suddenly stopped working. We fixed this by connecting to our own hotspot, this was in week 10, so it was about time we 
made the bot wireless anyway. This seemed to solve the internet problem for good.

We had some problems with the lidar just reading zeroes. This was a tricky issue as it could be multiple errors. It turned out to be multiple issues. 
The first and most problematic one was the wrong driver. We had the older lidar sensor which meant we had to get the driver labeled 1 instead of the usual newer one, which is number
2. Installing the older one fixed the problem in a way. We now got other readings than zeroes, but atleast half of our readings were zeroes. This problem was fixed
by reading the angle from -45 degrees to 0 and 0 to 45 degrees and taking the average. This seemed to be the most stable way of reading the distance to objects. 
It was however a bit limiting as we then limited our bot to only be able to look to the left and to the right.
